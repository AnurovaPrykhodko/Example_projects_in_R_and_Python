# Examples of code I written

### In R

**Nuclear lab**

Most recent, used for processing data taken from a lab, to create figures and tables for a report. This was never handed in, just for my own use. Figures and tables in folder. 

Code file: [nuclearlab.R](nuclear_lab/nuclearlab.R)

**Laborations from data proccessing course**

Mainly learning tidyverse, reading files, working in table format and visualizing. Figures and tables in each folder. 

**Laboration 2**

Code file [Laboration2.Rmd](laboartion2_files/Laboration2.Rmd)

Compiled file [Laboration2.md](laboartion2_files/Laboration2.md)

**Laboration 3**

Code file [Laboration3.Rmd](laboration3_files/Laboration3.Rmd)

Compiled file [Laboration3.md](laboration3_files/Laboration3.md)

**Laboration 4**

Code file [Laboration4.Rmd](laboration4_files/Laboration4.Rmd)

Compiled file [Laboration4.md](laboration4_files/Laboration4.md)

### In Pyton

I choose to only include one project, since it summarises great deal of what I learnt. Other projects I done is in numerical methods and statistics, though even if those included many exercices they all are shorter. 

**Programming course end project**

Purpose was to use open data from SMHI by making an interactive program that plots selected parameters by reading json files and processing them.
